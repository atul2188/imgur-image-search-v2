## Libraries Used

### Retrofit

[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It simplifies the process of sending network requests and handling responses.

### Hilt

[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces boilerplate code and makes it easy to manage dependencies in your application.

### MVVM

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural pattern that separates the UI logic from the business logic of the application. It promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain and test.

### Clean Architecture

[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is an architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of layers within an application. It promotes scalability, maintainability, and testability.

### Coroutines

[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) are a Kotlin feature that allow for asynchronous programming with ease and efficiency. They simplify the handling of asynchronous tasks, such as network requests, by providing a structured and concise way to write asynchronous code.

### Jetpack Compose

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is a modern UI toolkit for Android that simplifies and accelerates the process of building UIs. It allows for declarative UI design, making it easier to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
4. Use the search bar to enter keywords and search for images on Imgur.
5. View the search results and enjoy browsing through the images.
